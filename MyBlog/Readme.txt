Hi Professor,

I worked on a Blog project using spring mvc and hibernate. I completed CRUD operation on post and comment.
I tried to incorporate spring security and hibernate validation, but time was too short, so I couldn't finish in time. However i am 
still working on this Blog.
I coded by my own.

Thanks,
Lincoln
